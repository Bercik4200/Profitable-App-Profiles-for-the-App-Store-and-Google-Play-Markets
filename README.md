# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets
For this project, I'll be working as a data analyst for my company, which builds Android and iOS mobile apps. Our apps are available on both Google Play and the App Store.

Since all of our apps are free to download and install, our main source of revenue comes from in-app ads. This makes the number of users who engage with our apps critical to our revenue model â€” the more users who interact with the ads, the better it is for our business.

My goal in this project is to analyze the data and provide insights to help our developers understand which types of apps are likely to attract more users.
